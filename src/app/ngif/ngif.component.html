<p>ngif works!</p>

<div class="container">
  <button class="btn btn-success" (click)="onCreateBlock()">Create Block</button>
 <br>
  <!--we have created a propert by the name "isValid"-->
  <!--ngIf will show the above line once the statement is true -->
  <!--we need to create a method on the button
  to ensure that once the button is clicked
  we can get a message on the screen -->
  <div *ngIf="isValid">Bock has been created by the name "myBlock" </div>
</div>
